Subject: Data Model & Quality Review – Initial Findings and Next Steps

Hi,

I’ve completed an initial review of our unstructured JSON data and have developed a structured, relational model to support our reporting needs. Here’s a brief overview:

Data Model:

We’re modeling the core entities as Users, Receipts, and Brands (with an optional Receipt_Items table for item-level details).
This model supports our upcoming queries on monthly receipts, spend analyses, and user-specific transaction breakdowns.
Queries:

I’ve developed SQL queries to identify the top 5 brands by receipts scanned in the most recent month.
Additionally, I compared average spend on receipts with ‘Accepted’ versus ‘Rejected’ statuses to understand performance differences.
Data Quality Issues:

I identified some potential issues such as negative spend values, missing brand references, and duplicate user records.
These were uncovered by running SQL checks (and further confirmed via Python scripts). I’d appreciate further context on how these fields are expected to behave (e.g., is a negative spend an error or a valid refund?).
Questions & Next Steps:

Data Clarifications: Could you confirm if there are any business rules around negative totals or if missing brand IDs should be automatically corrected?
Data Quality Resolution: Do we have source system insights to verify these anomalies? I’m happy to work with the source teams to correct or flag these issues.
Scaling & Performance: As data volume grows, we may need to consider partitioning our Receipts table by month and indexing frequently joined keys (like brand_id and user_id) to ensure query performance.
I look forward to discussing these points and further optimizing our data assets.

Best regards,
